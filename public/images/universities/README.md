## Logo Optimization Tips

- Use PNG with transparent background for best results
- Ensure good contrast against white background
- Consider creating both light and dark versions if needed
- Test how they look at different sizes (they scale from h-8 to h-12)
- Use tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress if needed
- The logos will be displayed in grayscale by default and become colored on hover
